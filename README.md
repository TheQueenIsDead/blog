## Overview

### Paper

Paper is a `blog` which will (potentially) have many random writeup of my various shenanigans.

It uses a theme called [Papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) 

#### Posts

Create a new page by using hugo

```shell
hugo new posts/<name>.md
```

A full range of configuration options for the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation#sample-pagemd)

### LZ

LZ is a `landing zone` for displaying social links, it uses a neat theme called [Lynx](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/lynx/).
